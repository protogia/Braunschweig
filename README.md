A portrait made of data: Braunschweig

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks, to get deeper into the current datasets from the [opendata-portal of Braunschweig](https://opendata.braunschweig.de/). I would like to continue the repository in the long term.

The notebooks will be structured based on topics and expanded to include additional data sources where possible.

I look forward to valuable tips and colaboration. Of course you can use the notebooks for your own studies.
